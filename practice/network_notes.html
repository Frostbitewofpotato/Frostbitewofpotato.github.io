		<ul>
			<li>Protocol</li>
			<li>Packet: when a file needs to be sent over the internet, it gets broken into small pieces that are sent individually. Each packet has 2 parts...</li>
			<li>Header: part of a packet, think of it as a to and from on a letter. It tells information about where it's going to, where its come from, and a lot more. </li>
			<li> Payload: part of a packet, it's the actual contence of the packet </li>
			<li>Router: a place where their main job it to transmit items between other locations, like a train station or overlay in an airport </li>
			<li> Routing Table: honestly, I've got no clue. If I had to make an educated guess though... perhaps it was the map we made? that seems right...</li>
