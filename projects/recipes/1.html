		<h1>NitrolGlycerin</h1>
		<h3>Story</h3>
		<p>Nitrolglycerin is a valued and important aspect within my family, every year on the 21st night of September we gather together, all family up to 5th cousins, and preform the cerimony of crafting a gallon of nitrolglycerin.<br> I still remember my first time making nitrolglycerin... I was the honered one to get to add in the final amount of glycerin to the concoction, it was truely something</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Ingrediants</h3>
		<h5>and substitiutions</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Glycerol (Glycerin) I am legaly not allowed to tell you how much</li>
			<li>White fuming nitric acid, for this we'll say 10 grams</li>
			<ul>
				<li> alterative: azeotropic nitric acid</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Concentrated Sulfiric Acid, for this we'll say 10 grams </li>
				<ul>
					<li>alternative: Oleum -- Sulfuric Acid
					</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>Recipe </h3>
		<ol>
			<li>keep the acids (nitric acid and sulfuric acid) at about 72 degree F</li>
			<li>ensure that there is an ice cold pool of water nearby incase something goes wrong</li>
			<li> mix a 1 to 1 solution of nitric acid and sulfuric acid</li>
			<li>SLOWELY add the glycerin to the mixed acid</li>
			<li>and thats it!</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Safety</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>make sure the area is well ventalated and/or people where gas masks.</li>
			<li>if the temperature of the mixed acid ever exeeds 86 degree f then imediatly drown it in the cold water</li>
			<li>if the Glycerin is added to quickly then a toxic and explosive gas will be realeased, evacuate imediatly</li>
		</ul>
