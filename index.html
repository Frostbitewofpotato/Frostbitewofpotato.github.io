<blockquote>
	and the universe said I love you
	and the universe said you have played the game well
	and the universe said everything you need is within you
	and the universe said you are stronger than you know
	and the universe said you are the daylight
	and the universe said you are the night
	and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you
	and the universe said the light you seek is within you
	and the universe said you are not alone
	and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing
	and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing
	and the universe said you are the universe tasking itself, talking to itself, reading its own code
	and the universe said I live you because you are love
